Extension for Firefox and Chrome for Desktop Sharing in Jitsi Meet.

Highfive
=======
There are some changes made on this branch to tweak things to work for Highfive.  If something needs to be changed, just make the tweaks, update the version number in manifest.json and then zip up the files in the chrome folder and upload it as a new version of the extension on our chrome webstore account.

NOTE: there are .pem and .crx files that may be needed to upload a new version.  they're in the highfive secure password store.
